Remember to check out the [GitHub Bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/) and the [Glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) before playing with Git.

You can mess around with this repo however you'd like to. Don't worry about breaking stuff; we haven't coded anything anyways. Just get comfortable opening the project in your IDE. 

I (Anthony) have already created a NetBeans project inside this repo. That means that you should delete "Battleship" or "BattleshipOnline" projects before you start linking up the repo with your IDE. After you've successfully cloned this repo, you should be asked if you'd like to open the project "BattleshipOnline"

I would also read [this Netbeans howto guide](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/ide/git.html) regarding linking up the repo to your IDE. [This other article](https://github.com/benrbray/AdamBots-FIRST-2013-Robot-Code/wiki/How-To-Use-Git-&-Integrate-Git-With-NetBeans) is also pretty helpful and simplifies everything a bit.
